We believe the web is a tool for sharing knowledge and bringing people together, not as a place where users are profiled for targeted ads. We think that there are better ways of monetizing apps, services, and websites than through advertisements.

Internet should be a place to share and acquire knowledge, to communicate and socialize, not a marketplace where users get targeted and profiled for marketing purposes.

With the appearance of ad-blockers, a fierce debate has developed on whether blocking ads would mean the end of the free internet era. This argument sets a dangerous assumption: that content on the internet is there merely for commercial purposes, and that it's sole function is generating revenue to the publisher. We believe that, while this is a legitimate way to earn money, internet is much more than a global marketing showroom, it's a place for sharing ideas, publish content - without any lucrative purpose-, develop new ways of communication and enrichening mankind as a whole. Reducing it to just a monetary question doesn’t make any sense for us.

Thus, in order to defend what's left of the internet as a communication and knowledge cornerstone for people, we adhere to the “ no more ads ” manifesto , and declare that:

* We believe in a world where people can share their opinions, ideas, knowlege, artistic skills and craftmanship freely, just for the sake of helping others or as a communication channel with the world.

- We consider that this process, when conducted by altruistic reasons, enriches mankind as a whole .

- We believe that internet, the web and modern digital services and applications are the right tools for sharing all these ideas, opinions and knowledge, and we believe that these tools belong to the people, not to companies or organization pursuing commercial purposes.

- We are concerned that, progressively, internet is becoming a marketing playground, where content is shared only for commercial reasons, promoted content is becoming indistinguisable from real, legitimate content, and digital services are offered for “free” at the cost of users being tracked and profiled for advertisement reasons.

- We are worried that the privacy of users in internet is continuously being jeopardized, not by criminal organizations, but by advertisers and corporations, and that users are being educated to share their lives and give away their personal information, to be collected and incorporated into profiles for targeted ads.

- We don’t want to be tracked or profiled. We don’t want to be ubiquitously exposed to ads. We are human beings, we are not a product.

And so, in the spirit of the above beliefs and claims, we pledge to the following rules:

- We won’t be collecting or tracking information about our users in any of our services, websites or digital applications to elaborate a profile of them for advertising purposes.

- We won’t show any ads in our applications, digital services, websites or applications.

- We believe in legitimate business models that earn money through adding honest value to their users and customers, and we adhere to them.

- We will respect the privacy of our users. We won’t promote behaviors that teach our users to give away their personal information. We will always inform our users clearly about the privacy connotations of using our services, systems and applications.

- We won’t disguise promoted content as legitimate content into our applications, digital services or websites.

- We will promote behaviors that enrich people’s lives , help them share and acquire knowledge, and make the internet, websites, digital services and applications a more beautiful, simple and free place to stay.
