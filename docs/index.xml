      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to justify removing ads from your blog. What if your blog suddenly becomes popular? Without ads already in place, you might lose out on potential revenue. These are some thoughts that might run through your head.
What if you already have a steady income stream from advertising? If you are doing well, it might seem like a bad financial decision to remove the ads. I have come across several bloggers that were in this exact situation.</description>

      <description>After a couple years as a static website promoting the idea of a web without ads, we are finally launching a blog. Our goal is to continue promoting an ad-free web through this new medium, hopefully reaching a larger audience and sharing more practical advice.
Not many people like ads, especially on the web. The two most popular ad blockers on Firefox have a combined 15,000,000 users, and uBlock Origin in the Chrome Web Store has 10,000,000+ users.</description>

      <description>The web is a tool for sharing knowledge and bringing people together, not as a place where users are profiled for targeted ads. There are better ways of monetizing apps, services, and websites than through advertisements.
The Problem We are concerned that, progressively, internet is becoming a marketing playground, where content is shared only for commercial reasons, promoted content is becoming indistinguishable from real, legitimate content, and digital services are offered for &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; at the cost of users being tracked and profiled for advertisement reasons.</description>
